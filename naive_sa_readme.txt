# Naive_SA
Naive sentiment analysis categorizes text sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) using simple methods like counting sentiment-laden words from predefined lists. It lacks the sophistication to understand context, irony, or nuanced language, often leading to less accurate results compared to more advanced techniques.
